# Advanced Bookdown {#advanced}


## Cross-reference 
Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab). 
And it works even the item is not in this chapter.

Refer to a chapter, you can use a single set of brackets with the name of that chapter `[Basic Bookdown]` to access to [Basic Bookdown]

## Citation
You can store your citation in a plain text .bib file and then simply cite what you want by `@key`. For example, @R-base and @sample

Here comes a example of content in .bib file:
```
@Journal{sample,
  title = {this is a sample reference},
  author = {{NA}},
  organization = {Test center},
  address = {USA},
  year = {2019},
  url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
}
```
