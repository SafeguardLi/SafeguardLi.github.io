Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. And it works even the item is not in this chapter. Refer to a chapter, you can use a single set of brackets with the name of that chapter [Basic Bookdown] to access to Basic Bookdown 3.2 Citation You can store your citation in a plain text .bib file and then simply cite what you want by @key. For example, R Core Team (2016) and NA (2019) Here comes a example of content in .bib file: @Journal{sample, title = {this is a sample reference}, author = {{NA}}, organization = {Test center}, address = {USA}, year = {2019}, url = {https://www.R-project.org/}, } References "],
